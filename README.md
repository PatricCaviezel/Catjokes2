## Description

Similar to original [catJokes](https://github.com/PatricCaviezel/CatJokes) created by [Jon](https://github.com/jonlanda), [Patric](https://github.com/PatricCaviezel) and [Luc](https://github.com/LucHauser). This time we used JavaScript instead of PHP and we added some new features.
In addition to this we also upgraded our CSS.
On This Website you can create your own little cat buddy, view cute pictures of cats paired with a random fact and a joke, some information about the contributors aswell as our socials. We also added the game which [Fabio](https://github.com/FabioKaelin) and [Jon](https://github.com/jonlanda) made.
